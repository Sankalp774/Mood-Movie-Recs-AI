# Mood-Movie-Recs-AI
### Project Overview  
Mood Movie Recs AI is designed to revolutionize how users discover and engage with films by combining artificial intelligence, social collaboration, and gamification. The app goes beyond traditional recommendation systems by leveraging advanced AI to understand user preferences, moods, and viewing habits while fostering a strong community of film enthusiasts.  

### Key Features  

#### AI-Powered Recommendations  

**Hyper-Personalized Suggestions**  
The app analyzes user ratings, watched genres, favorite actors, and opt-in social media activity to curate tailored movie recommendations. Machine learning models continuously adapt based on viewing history and user feedback.  

**Mood-Based Discovery**  
Users can select their current mood, such as adventurous, nostalgic, or relaxed, to receive movie suggestions that match their emotional state. The mood analysis considers factors like time of day, weather, and cultural trends.  

**Smart Discovery Feed**  
A curated feed highlights trending movies, festival award winners, and hidden gems. AI-driven updates ensure recommendations stay relevant, factoring in global events like award shows and holidays.  

#### Social & Collaborative Features  

**Virtual Watch Parties**  
Users can host synchronized movie nights with friends, featuring real-time chat and reactions. The app includes interactive elements like trivia games and polls during playback.  

**Movie Clubs & Communities**  
Users can join niche communities focused on specific interests, such as indie films or classic action movies. Collaborative challenges, like creating the ultimate heist movie marathon, encourage group participation.  

**Follow Creators & Critics**  
The app allows users to follow directors, actors, and trusted critics for personalized recommendations. AI-generated summaries highlight key insights from reviews.  

#### Gamified Movie Experience  

**Achievements & Badges**  
Users earn rewards for reaching milestones, such as rating 100 movies or exploring multiple genres. Top contributors can unlock exclusive content like behind-the-scenes clips.  

**Interactive Challenges**  
Weekly missions, such as watching a movie from every continent or binging a directorâ€™s trilogy, keep users engaged. A global leaderboard tracks movie knowledge and challenge progress.  

#### Advanced Rating & Review System  

**Granular Feedback**  
Users can rate movies across multiple dimensions, including acting, direction, cinematography, soundtrack, story, pacing, emotional impact, and rewatchability. Interactive radar charts help visualize ratings.  

**Mood Tracking & Insights**  
Users log their emotions before and after watching a movie to track how films affect their mood. AI generates personalized reports based on mood trends.  

**Smart Review Assistance**  
AI-powered prompts help users write detailed reviews, offering comparisons to similar films. The app can also highlight memorable quotes and key scenes.  

### Technical Implementation  

- **AI/ML Models**: Mood classification using NLP (BERT) and sentiment analysis. Collaborative filtering and deep learning techniques for recommendations using TensorFlow or PyTorch.  
- **APIs**: TMDB for movie data, YouTube for trailers, Spotify for soundtrack integration, and OpenWeatherMap for mood-based recommendations.  
- **Social Features**: Firebase Realtime Database for interactions and WebSocket-based chat for seamless communication.  
- **Frontend**: Built using Jetpack Compose with Lottie animations and dynamic theme switching for a smooth user experience.
