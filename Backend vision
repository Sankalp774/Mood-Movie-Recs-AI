#Overview
The backend serves as the core engine that processes user data, interacts with AI models, and delivers personalized movie recommendations. It is responsible for:

Storing and managing user data and movie preferences.
Processing AI-powered recommendations.
Handling API requests and responses.
Implementing authentication and security measures.

#Tech Stack
Backend Framework: Flask / Django / FastAPI (Choose based on preference)
Database: PostgreSQL / Firebase Firestore / MongoDB
AI Models: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers
APIs: TMDB API (for movie data), OpenAI GPT (for review analysis)
Hosting & Deployment: Firebase Functions / AWS Lambda / Heroku / Render

#AI Features Integration
1. Personalized Recommendations
Uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest movies.
Model trains on user interactions (likes, ratings, watch history).
Example: A KNN-based or matrix factorization model (SVD, ALS).

2. Mood-Based Recommendations
Uses sentiment analysis and NLP to match movies to moods.
Example: BERT-based classification model assigns moods to movies.

3. Discovery Feed
Fetches trending movies, festival winners, and hidden gems from APIs.
Uses AI to highlight "movies you may have missed."

4. Review Analysis
NLP model (e.g., BERT, GPT) analyzes user reviews.
Extracts sentiment, keywords, and themes to improve recommendations.
